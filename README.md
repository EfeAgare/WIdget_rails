 ## Installation
  - Ensure you have the technologies/dependencies installed then you can clone this repository with the URL from the <code> clone or download button on this page </code> using <code> git clone *cloned url copied* </code> in your local machine. Afterwards, run <code> bundle install </code>, followed by  <code> yarn install </code>. 
 -  Setup your database, though you wouldn't be using it but you need to set it push, after install Postgres, by running <code> rails db:create </code> 
 -  Setup *client_id* and *client_secret* environment variables in you config/.env.yml file, the .env.yml file doesn't exit so you will have to create it.
 -  If the above is setup you can test the app by running <code> rails s </code> and going to http://localhost:8080 to test the app
